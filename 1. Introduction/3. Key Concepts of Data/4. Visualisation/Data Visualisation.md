### **Why This Matters to You (Spoiler: It’s a Clout Game)**

1. **Go Viral**: Data viz makes your content *stand out*. Think of it as the *“Wait, what?”* factor.

3. **Spot BS**: Recognize when influencers lie with graphs. Example: A bar chart that *looks* like they doubled their followers—but the y-axis starts at 500.
4. **Win at Everything**: From impressing your crush with your step count to making your group chat go wild for your Spotify Wrapped.
