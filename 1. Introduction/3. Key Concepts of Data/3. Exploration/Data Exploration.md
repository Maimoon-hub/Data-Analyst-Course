### **Detective Toolkit: 3 Ways to Spot Patterns Like Sherlock**

#### **1. Trend Analysis (The Viral Clue)**
**What it is**: Tracking what’s *changing over time* to spot patterns.
- **Example**: TikTok notices raccoon dance videos spiked in popularity at 2 AM → *“Recommend more raccoon chaos!”*
- **How to do it**:
  - **Scroll back**: Check your TikTok For You Page history. What trends emerged?
  - **Compare dates**: Did your Spotify Wrapped show more lo-fi during finals week?
- **Why it matters**: Trends are the “aha!” moments—like realizing you’ve been doomscrolling for 3 hours.

#### **2. Correlation Detection (Linking the Dots)**
**What it is**: Finding connections between unrelated things.
- **Example**: Netflix sees you binge *Stranger Things* and *Money Heist* → *“You love suspense. Try *Squid Game*.”*
- **How to do it**:
  - **Ask “Why?”**: “Why did my Instagram likes drop after I stopped using #GenZGossip?”
  - **Compare behaviors**: “Do I watch more anime when I’m stressed?”
- **Why it matters**: Correlations are the *red herrings* and *actual suspects*. Ever notice you crave pizza every time you watch *Friends* reruns? Data exploration explains that.

#### **3. Anomaly Hunting (Finding the Odd One Out)**
**What it is**: Spotting outliers that don’t fit the pattern.
- **Example**: Your Steam stats show you played *Half-Life* for 10 hours straight, but *Call of Duty*? Zero.
- **How to do it**:
  - **Zoom in**: Check your TikTok engagement. Why did one video get 10K views while the rest got 10?
  - **Question spikes**: “Why did I spend $50 on skincare in one day?”
- **Why it matters**: Anomalies are the *twists*—like finding out your crush liked your post at 3 AM. Coincidence? Or a clue?
